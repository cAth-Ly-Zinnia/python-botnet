# python-botnet
Computer Networking Final Project from Winter 2022 using Command and Control (Client/Server Architecture)

## Introduction

This repository project work that uses a central user to command zombie bots to run, query, kill, and stop.

## Project Detail

Within this project, I wanted to create zombie/s that would run and be run on with multi-threading. While the server handles multiple operations at once, meaning 5 zombies on one computer can work on five separate files simultaneously.

Users can assign the zombies remotely or in real terms, users can give them commands on a separate computer.

## Challenges

This project made me realize that string parsing is VERY important. Especially, when I was making certain requests for our bots to obtain information based on other file-viewing libraries.

## What did I learn

I learned that there are so many fun projects outside of application development. During my time in college, I learned that there are so many disciplines within Computer Science or technology that lie in CS foundations.
