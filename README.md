# python-botnet
Computer Networking project from Winter 2022 using command and control
Final Project that uses a central user to command zombie bots to run, query, kill, and stop.

The zombie/s would run and can be run on with multi-threading, as well as multiple operations at once, meaning 5 zombies on one computer can work on five separate files.

Users can assign the zombies remotely meaning that they can use they give commands on a separate computer
